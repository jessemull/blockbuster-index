      The <strong>Blockbuster Index</strong> is a playful exploration of how
      consumer buying habits have shifted from traditional brick-and-mortar
      stores to digital purchases across the United States. Inspired by the
      nostalgic decline of physical video rental stores like Blockbuster, this
      project creates a unique index that scores each state based on various
      signals reflecting the balance of online versus in-person purchases.

      The <strong>Blockbuster Index</strong> website visualizes these scores and
      trends, providing users with an engaging way to see how retail behaviors
      vary geographically, combining humor and data-driven insights.
